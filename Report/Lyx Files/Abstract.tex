The LISA scientific space mission will detect gravitational waves by measuring the relative displacement of pairs of free floating test masses set into geodesic motion onboard of thee spacecraft. Inside each satellite, the injection of the test masses from the caged configuration into the geodesic trajectory will be performed by the grabbing positioning and relase mechanism. To provide a successful injection, the test masses must be dynamically relased with a minimal residual velocity against adhesion with the holding device.
In the following paper we will proceed throug the derivaition and the integration of the system of linear ODEs that describes the forementionsed grabbing positioning and relase mechanism.

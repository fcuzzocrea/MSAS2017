The LISA scientific space mission will detect gravitational waves by measuring the relative displacement of a pairs of free floating test masses set into geodesic motion on-board of three spacecraft. Inside each satellite, the injection of the test masses from the caged configuration into the geodesic trajectory will be performed by the Grabbing Positioning and Relased Mechanism (GPRM). To provide a successful injection, the test masses must be relased with a minimal residual velocity against the adhesion with the holding device.
In the following document we will proceed trough the derivation and the integration of the system of linear ODEs that describes the forementioned grabbing positioning and relase mechanism.

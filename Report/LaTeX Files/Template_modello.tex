\section{The real system}

The LISA Pathfinder grabbing position and relase mechanism (abbreviated
as GPRM) is the system aimed to lock and relase the test mass (from
now on TM) into the spacecraft. 

In fact, forementioned TM has to be relased with a nearly zero velocity
with respect to the transport spacecraft to be correctly injected
into a geodesic trajectory (wich is what we aim for). 

This task can be relatively complex, if we think of the possible interactions
that develope with the support, and because of the electrostatic aspects
that may generate disturbing forces. Also, least but not last, the
quality of the surface of the test mass and of the grabbing finger
should be take into account.
The GPRM mechanism is sketched in Fig 1.

It's main parts are :
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Grabbing Finger} : holds the TM and positions it prior relase;
\item \textit{Finger Tip} : last contact part that pons the TM in position before
fast retraction for relase;
\item \textit{Low Voltage Piezo Actuator} : used for the positioning and fast Finger;
Tip relase;
\item \textit{NEXLINE actuator} : used for Grabbing Finger movement;
\item \textit{Displacemente Sensor} : to measure the axial force acting between the mechanism contacting interface
\end{itemize}
